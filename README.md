## Introduction

Hello, my name is Léopold and I am currently (2025) a student at Telecom Paris. I follow the MITRO (theoretical computer science) and ACCQ (applied algebra) courses. 

This repository contains the computer science work I did during my scholarship in Télécom Paris (not everything I did, but everything involving personnal work), and the presentations I did as the president of the competitive programming association in 2024/2025.

## Structure 


The structure of the repository is the following : 
- **accq** contains folders such as algebra algorithms, finite algebraic structures (for instance the implementation of a large prime number generator using quadratic residuals), arithmetic algorithms...
- **mitro** contains folders related to theoretical computer science, for instance Edmonds Karp algorithm for maximum matching, segment trees, ...
- **matieres-1A** contains the work I did during my first year at Télécom Paris, such as a Typescript course, the implementation of a consensus protocol on a blockchain, programming a robot car, ...
- **telecode** is the name of the competitive programming association of Télécom Paris, and contains all the work which was presented.
